Problem Statement: Write the code to calculate the spatial position with respect to frame {A} when the position in frame {B} is represented by [2,3,0] and b is rotationg aroung x axis by 30 degree, y axis by 30 degree, z axis by 30 degree. Write the final postion with respect to frame A.

Sample input/output:

```
This program can be used to calculate the spatial position with respect to frame {A/B} 
when the postion in frame {B/A} and translations and/or rotations are known.

Enter rotation in X axis (in degrees): 30
Enter rotation in Y axis (in degrees): 30
Enter rotation in Z axis (in degrees): 30
Enter translation along X axis: 0
Enter translation along Y axis: 0
Enter translation along Z axis: 0
Point is known in frame? (A/B): B

Enter coordinates of the point in the frame: 0 2 3

Position of the point in other frame is: (1.442, 1.1, 3.116)
